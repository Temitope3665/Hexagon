            Aspirin Tablets is not suitable for use as an
            anti-inflammatory/analgesic/antipyretic. Recommended for use in
            adults and adolescents from 16 years of age. This medicinal product
            is not recommended for use in adolescents/children under 16 years
            unless the expected benefits outweigh the risks. Acetylsalicylic
            acid may be a contributory factor in the causation of Reye's
            Syndrome in some children. There is an increased risk of haemorrhage
            and prolongation of bleeding time particularly during or after
            surgery (even in cases of minor procedures, e.g. tooth extraction).
            Use with caution before surgery, including tooth extraction.
            Temporary discontinuation of treatment may be necessary. Aspirin
            Tablets is not recommended during menorrhagia where it may increase
            menstrual bleeding. Aspirin Tablets is to be used with caution in
            cases of uncontrolled hypertension and when patients have a past
            history of gastric or duodenal ulcer or haemorrhagic episodes or are
            undergoing therapy with anticoagulants. Patients should report any
            unusual bleeding symptoms to their physician. If gastrointestinal
            bleeding or ulceration occurs the treatment should be withdrawn.
            Acetylsalicylic acid should be used with caution in patients with
            moderately impaired renal or hepatic function (contraindicated if
            severe), or in patients who are dehydrated since the use of NSAIDs
            may result in deterioration of renal function. Liver function tests
            should be performed regularly in patients presenting slight or
            moderate hepatic insufficiency. Acetylsalicylic acid may promote
            bronchospasm and asthma attacks or other hypersensitivity reactions.
            Risk factors are existing asthma, hay fever, nasal polyps or chronic
            respiratory diseases. The same applies for patients who also show
            allergic reaction to other substances (e.g. with skin reactions,
            itching or urticaria). Serious skin reactions, including
            Steven-Johnsons syndrome, have rarely been reported in association
            with the use of acetylsalicylic acid (see section 4.8). Aspirin
            Tablets should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash,
            mucosal lesions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Elderly
            patients are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of
            NSAIDs, including acetylsalicylic acid especially gastrointestinal
            bleeding and perforation which may be fatal (see section 4.2). Where
            prolonged therapy is required, patients should be reviewed
            regularly. Concomitant treatment with Aspirin Tablets and other
            drugs that alter haemostasis (i.e. anticoagulants such as warfarin,
            thrombolytic and antiplatelet agents, anti-inflammatory drugs and
            selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) is not recommended, unless
            strictly indicated, because they may enhance the risk of haemorrhage
            (see section 4.5). If the combination cannot be avoided, close
            observation for signs of bleeding is recommended. Caution should be
            advised in patients receiving concomitant medications which could
            increase the risk of ulceration, such as oral corticosteroids,
            selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and deferasirox (see section
            4.5). Acetylsalicylic acid should be avoided in late pregnancy and
            generally during breast feeding (see section 4.6). Acetylsalicylic
            acid in low doses reduces uric acid excretion. Due to this fact,
            patients who tend to have reduced uric acid excretion may experience
            gout attacks (see section 4.5). The risk of hypoglycaemic effect
            with sulfonylureas and insulins may be potentiated with Aspirin
            Tablets taken at over dosage (see section 4.5). Aspirin should be
            used with caution in patients with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
            deficiency.

            Overdose
          </Text>
          <Text mt="10px">
            Although considerable inter-individual variations are involved, it
            can be considered that the toxic dose is about 200 mg/kg in adults
            and 100 mg/kg in children. The lethal dose of acetylsalicylic acid
            is 25-30 grams. Plasma salicylate concentrations above 300 mg/l
            indicate intoxication. Plasma concentrations above 500 mg/l in
            adults and 300 mg/l in children generally cause severe toxicity.
            Overdose may be harmful for elderly patients and particularly for
            small children (therapeutic overdose or frequent accidental
            intoxications may be fatal). Symptoms of moderate intoxications
            Tinnitus, hearing disorders, headache, vertigo, confusion and
            gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain).
            Symptoms of severe intoxications Symptoms are related to severe
            disruption of the acid-base balance. In the first instance
            hyperventilation occurs, which results in respiratory alkalosis.
            Respiratory acidosis ensues due to suppression of the respiratory
            centre. In addition, metabolic acidosis occurs as a result of the
            presence of salicylate. Since younger children are often not seen
            until they have reached a late stage of intoxication, they are
            usually in the stage of acidosis. Furthermore, the following
            symptoms may occur: hyperthermia and perspiration, resulting in
            dehydration: feelings of restlessness, convulsions, hallucinations
            and hypoglycaemia. Depression of the nervous system may lead to
            coma, cardiovascular collapse or respiratory arrest. Treatment of
            overdose If a toxic dose has been ingested, hospital admission is
            required. In the event of moderate intoxication, inducing the
            patient to vomit should be attempted. If this fails, gastric lavage
            may be attempted during the first hour after ingestion of a
            substantial amount of the medicine. Afterwards, administer activated
            carbon (adsorbent) and sodium sulfate (laxative). Activated charcoal
            may be given as a single dose (50 g for an adult, 1 g/kg body weight
            for a child up to 12 years). Alkalisation of the urine (250 mmol
            NaHCO3, for three hours) whilst checking urine pH levels. In the
            event of severe intoxication, haemodialysis is to be preferred.
            Other symptoms to be treated symptomatically.

            Pharmacodynamic properties
          </Text>
          <Text mt="10px">
            Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents: platelet
            aggregation inhibitors excl. heparin, ATC code: B01AC06. Mechanism
            of action Acetylsalicylic acid inhibits the platelet activation:
            blocking the platelet cyclooxygenase by acetylation, it inhibits
            thromboxane A2 synthesis, a physiological activating substance
            released by the platelets and which would play a role in the
            complications of the atheromatosic lesions. Inhibition of
            TXA2-synthesis is irreversible, because thrombocytes, which have no
            nucleus, are not capable (due to lack of protein synthesis
            capability) to synthesise new cyclooxygenase, which had been
            acetylated by acetylsalicylic acid. Pharmacodynamic effects The
            repeated doses from 20 to 325 mg involve an inhibition of the
            enzymatic activity from 30 to 95%. Due to the irreversible nature of
            the binding, the effect persists for the lifespan of a thrombocyte
            (7-10 days). The inhibiting effect does not exhaust during prolonged
            treatments and the enzymatic activity gradually begins again upon
            renewal of the platelets 24 to 48 hours after treatment
            interruption. Acetylsalicylic acid extends bleeding time on average
            by approximately 50 to 100%, but individual variations can be
            observed. Experimental data suggest that ibuprofen may inhibit the
            effect of low dose acetylsalicylic acid on platelet aggregation when
            they are dosed concomitantly. In one study, when a single dose of
            ibuprofen 400 mg was taken within 8 h before or within 30 min after
            immediate release acetylsalicylic acid dosing (81 mg), a decreased
            effect of acetylsalicylic acid on the formation of thromboxane or
            platelet aggregation occurred. However, the limitations of these
            data and the uncertainties regarding extrapolation of ex vivo data
            to the clinical situation imply that no firm conclusions can be made
            for regular ibuprofen use, and no clinically relevant effect is
            considered to be likely for occasional ibuprofen use.
